/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Cogmora Labs Paper Trading Engine.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user has a dedicated data tree
 * under `/users/{userId}`, and only the authenticated user with the matching `uid` can
 * read or write data within their own tree.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - `/users/{userId}`: Stores user profile information.
 * - `/users/{userId}/paperTradingContext/main`: Singleton document with the user's paper trading settings.
 * - `/users/{userId}/paperTradingContext/main/openPositions/{positionId}`: Open positions.
 * - `/users/{userId}/paperTradingContext/main/tradeHistory/{tradeId}`: Historical trades.
 * - `/users/{userId}/paperTradingContext/main/watchlist/{symbol}`: User's watchlist.
 * - `/users/{userId}/paperTradingContext/main/tradeTriggers/{triggerId}`: Trade triggers.
 * - `/users/{userId}/paperTradingContext/main/priceAlerts/{symbol}`: Price alerts.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Only authenticated users can access their own data.
 * - No public data access is permitted.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - The rules rely on the `request.auth.uid` to match the `userId` in the path. No denormalization is needed.
